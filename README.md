## Final project for PIE00088

This is the final project for the course PIE00088 - Laboratory of Imperative
Programming in Python Language. In this project, we used data for sentiment
analysis. We built a predictive model to identify which emotion a person is
feeling based on their message (sentence), and implemented this model in a web
app built with the Streamlit framework in Python. The work was carried out by
Bruno Montezano and Aline Zimerman, both PhD students in the Postgraduate
Program in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at UFRGS.
